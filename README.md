# Neural Network

This neural network was completed for "Using Python for Research" course on HarvardX. The neural network was made using tensorflow and used to predict activities (e.g., walking, sitting) from accelerometer data in two different datasets. These two datasets were the course-given datasets (train_time_series.csv, train_labels, test_time_series.csv, test_labels) and a WISDM dataset (WISDM_ar_v1.1.raw.txt).

1.) WISDM dataset could not be added [file too large], but a link to it is included in main.ipynb. The dataset file must be named "WISDM_ar_v1.1.raw.txt" in order to run with the program on main.ipynb.
2.) Datasets generated by running main.ipynb are included in generated_datasets folder
